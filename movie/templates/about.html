            <p>This web application was developed as part of a programming course project. It allows users to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View and search for movies</li>
                <li>See key details like genre, duration, and rating</li>
                <li>Access external links for more info</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project was built using <strong>Django</strong>, with Bootstrap 5 for styling and layout. It's connected to a database where all the movie data is stored, and offers a responsive, clean interface.</p>
